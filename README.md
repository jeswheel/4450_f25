## Notes to self

- The course is too close to 3352, particularly if it will be taught to graduate students. Here are some ideas for future semesters: 
- In Chapter~1, start with a brief introduction to sigma-algebras and measure spaces. The assumption is that these details are beyond most students (given this is not a measure theory course), but a subtle introduction is a good idea for the more advanced students. For instance, follow the first chapter of Casella and Berger.
- Chapter 2: 
   - I like starting with the current "introduction" section, but I don't like going straight from this intro into discrete distributions.
   - Instead, after the intro-slide, follow sections 1.4 and 1.5 of Casella and Berger. After Definition 1.5.7, we can go back to the discrete / continuous slides as before. 
- For chapter 2, don't introduce the distribution function seperately for discrete and continuous random variables. Instead, start with definitions from sections 1.4 and 1.5 of Casella and Berger. You could follow Casella an Berger until Definition 1.5.7;
