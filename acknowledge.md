* The framework to help build the online version of this course was developed by my Ph.D. advisor, [Edward L. Ionides](https://ionides.github.io). 
Specifically, this course framework was originally built for a time-series analysis course, Stats 531 at the University of Michigan.
See, for instance, the [2024 course](https://ionides.github.io/531w24) that I TA'd when I was a Ph.D. student, the source-code of which was copied to build this course. 
Previous other versions of this course were presented in [2016](https://ionides.github.io/531w16), [2018](https://ionides.github.io/531w18), [2020](https://ionides.github.io/531w20), [2021](https://ionides.github.io/531w21), and  [2022](https://ionides.github.io/531w22).

* Contributions are gratefully acknowledged from all former students of Edward L. Ionides and graduate student instructors (GSIs).

* GSIs were
