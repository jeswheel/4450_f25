\section{Course Description}

A calculus-based introduction to statistical procedures, including simple regression, basic experimental design, and non-parametric methods. 
PREREQ: MATH 1160 or MATH 1170.

This course is 3 Credit Hours, and we meet every Monday, Wednesday, Friday 9:00 am - 9:50 am, PS 324, with the exception of university-observed holidays and breaks.

This course is a prerequisite for Math 4457, Math 4458, and Math 4459. A student must earn a C- or better in this class in order to use this as a pre-requisite for one of these courses.

\subsection{Course Objectives and Outcomes}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Students will perform a descriptive data analysis for one variable and descrive the relation between two variables.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Select and display the proper graph for the data.
    \item Compute the appropriate numberical values for summarizing the variable or relationship.
    \item Write an informative but brief descritption of the variable or relation between variables in the context of the problem.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Students will demonstrate an understanding of probability models.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Perform computations using the basic axioms and rules of probability. 
    \item Compute probabilities using a common probability model.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Students will perform an inferential analysis.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Perform a hypothesis test or construct a confidence interval. 
    \item Assess the required assumptions and conditions.
    \item Select and compute the appropriate numerical values.
    \item State a correct conclusion in the context of the problem.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Course Format}

This is a standard class where we will meet in-person.
All students are required to attend all classes during the first week. 
Any student having to miss during the first week needs instructor approval. 
Students will be dropped from their courses if they do not attend the first week and do not have permission from the instructor.

After the first week of classes, attendance is expected but will not be recorded.
Lectures will not be recorded, but slides will be available to students who miss lecture.
Course materials, activities, and assignments will be posted on Canvas.\\ 

\textbf{General course information can be found at the course website:} \url{https://jeswheel.github.io/3350\_f25}

\subsection{Assessment Methods}

Student understanding will be assessed via homework, quizes, a midterm exam, and a final exam.

\section{Textbook and Course Materials}

\begin{hangparas}{0.25in}{1}
Baldi, Brigitte, and David S. Moore. \emph{The practice of statistics in the life sciences}. Freeman, 2012. ISBN: 9781319403348.
\end{hangparas}

\subsection{Software}

This semester we will use the \Rlogo\, programming language; 
for the purpose of our class, think of this software as a special calculator used for Statistics.
To interact with this software, I highly recommend using RStudio, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) built for writing \Rlogo\, code.

\textbf{Why R?} R and RStudio are both free, and widely used software in both academia and industry. 
R has been built specifically to help practicioners do statistics easily.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Installing \Rlogo: \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{https://cran.r-project.org/}
  \item Installing RStudio: \href{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}. 
  Note that you should install \Rlogo\, prior to installing RStudio.
\end{itemize}

Other types of calculators are permitted, but it is not anticipated that they will be beneficial beyond what you can do in R.

\caption{Grade Breakdown}
\end{table}

An instructor may give an X grade when a student has not attended or stops attending, therefore giving the instructor no basis to calculate a grade for that student.
The X grade is equivalent to an F. 
No credits or grade points are awarded in any courses for which an X grade is reported.

\section{Schedule (Tentative)}

The table below provides a tentative schedule of the course. 
This table will be updated on the course website as needed.

\subsection{Exams}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Final Exam}: Wednesday, Dec 17, 7:30-9:30 a.m. (Sorry about the time, I didn't chose this). The location will be our regular classroom. 
  \item \textbf{Midterm}: Planned for {\color{blue} \textbf{Oct 17}}, during regular class time. Tentatively, the midterm will cover Chapters 1-10.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Homeworks}

Homeworks make up the largest portion of your final grade. There will be 10 homework assignments, each worth $5\%$ of your grade.
Homework assignments will be due one week after they are assigned, which will be made clear to students via Canvas announcements.
Late homework submissions will not be accepted, unless permission is provided by the instructor.

\subsection{Quizes}

There may be periodic quizes on Canvas. The point of these quizes is the assess student comprehension and satisfaction with the course.
Some questions will be knowledge based, others survey / opinion based. 
Students who complete the quizes will be awarded full points, regardless of whether or not they answer questions correctly.

\section{Academic Complaints / Grievances}

Students with academic complaints / grievances should first meet with the instroctor responsible for the policy, proceedure, or decision that resulted in the student's initial complaint/grievance. If the student is still dissatisfied after that meeting, the student should next meet with the instructor's department chair (Dr. Rault, PS 318B, patrickrault@isu.edu) and then with the dean of the college (Dr. Widman, PS 120A, jameswidmann@isu.edu). For more information, see: \url{https://www.isu.edu/deanofstudents/advocacy-services/}.
